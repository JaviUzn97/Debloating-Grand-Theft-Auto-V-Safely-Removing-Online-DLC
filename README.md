Debloating Grand Theft Auto V: Safely Removing Online DLC

When you install Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) with all its downloadable content (DLC), the game can weigh in at a hefty 108 GB. A significant portion of this DLC is dedicated to online content, offering no benefits to the game's core offline story mode.
However, it's crucial to understand that not all DLC can be removed without consequences. Some DLC packs introduce valuable enhancements like new weapon customizations, vehicles, weapons, and races that aren't present in the base game. They also contribute to overall game stability, fix old bugs from the original release, and even include frame scaling options that were absent initially.

Attempting to delete all multiplayer DLC will damage your base game. You'll encounter critical issues such as:
    • Inability to start the first Tonya Strangers and Freaks mission, which is essential for game progression.
    • The inability to shoot from a motorcycle or ATV.
    • Game crashes when attempting to purchase a weapon from Ammu-Nation with the Yusuf luxury finish.
    • Broken missions and various other gameplay disruptions.
The common misconception is that the only option is to keep all DLC, leaving your game perpetually "bloated."

A Solution for Offline Players

I've personally completed GTA V's story mode, and my approach involved storing the DLC in a separate folder. Whenever an error occurred, I would quickly save my progress, exit the game, and then meticulously move each necessary DLC file from its temporary location back to the game's main folder. I've managed to achieve 100% completion in the offline game using this method.
The key takeaway is that certain DLC files must not be removed from the Grand Theft Auto V\update\x64\dlcpacks folder.
